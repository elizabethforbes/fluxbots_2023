# fluxbots_2023
Github repository for fluxbots 3.0, aka the deployment of a fluxbot array in Newfoundland in summer 2023

# README:
The fluxbot 3.0 project is the next version of the fluxbot 2.0 project, which was designed and deployed in 2019 in the Kenya Long term Exclosure Experiment at Mpala Research Centre and Conservancy. The fluxbot has been redesigned to better suit the ecology of Newfoundland, Canada, where an array will be deployed in summer 2023. This includes a less home-machined chamber, an updated MCU with cellular data transmission abilities, a new and more widely-studied CO2 sensor, and more.

The fluxbot 3.0 repository will include updated code to process raw data into flux estimates in large batches (e.g. from the entire array), as well as other analytical processes (e.g. QAQC).

The repository will also include a full schematic of the physical design; access to the MCU's software, and other details necessary for replication of the fluxbot approach by others.
